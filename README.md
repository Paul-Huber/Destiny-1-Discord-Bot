# Destiny-1-Discord-Bot
A basic Discord bot built in JavaScript to add functionality to a public Discord server for the video game Destiny 1. Its primary purpose is role management, adding and removing roles from users with little to no assistance. The bot is also able to retrieve and parse data from the Destiny 1 web API found here: https://bungie-net.github.io/
